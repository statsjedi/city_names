# city_names
I was curious as to the distribution of the most common city names in the USA, so I got lists of names off Wikipedia, coordinates off Google Maps, and plotted them in R.

* city names and coordinates.xlsx -- the spatial data
* final.png -- map
* final_small.png -- small map
* map_final.R -- R code to generate the map
* nacol.R -- R code to color map according to 5 color theorem
* traveling_salesperson_general.R -- R code to calculate tours of cities according to a traveling salesperson algorithm
